    "## Why are we here?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To provide some of the scaffolding needed to become excellent and efficient data scientists, including computer programming, data wrangling, and data exploration & analysis.\n",
    "2. To provide BOTH i) a soft landing for psychology and neuroscience trainees who are very new to programming, AND ii) an opportunity for more advanced coders to further hone / develop their skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specific learning objectives:\n",
    "1. Proficiency in Python and R programming languages.\n",
    "2. Efficient and effective data wrangling skills.\n",
    "3. Advanced data visualization capabilities.\n",
    "4. Introduction to advanced data modeling and prediction.\n",
